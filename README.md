# ITSP-2k15
Project developed for ITSP-2015.
This is a spam filter for the IITB GPO Webmail service.
The spam filter detects certain blacklisted and whitelisted keywords in the mail.In future, machine learning can be used to smartly train the filter.
GUI isn't added since there is not much use and also it slows down the program considerably.
Blacklisted.txt and Whitelisted.txt should be modified for personal use. Although a sample has been provided.
